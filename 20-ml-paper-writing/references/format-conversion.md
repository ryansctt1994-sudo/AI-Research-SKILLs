# ML Paper Writing for Top AI Conferences: Conference Resubmission & Format Conversion

When a paper is rejected or withdrawn from one venue and resubmitted to another, format conversion is required. This is a common workflow in ML research.

## Workflow 3: Converting Between Conference Formats

```text
Format Conversion Checklist:
- [ ] Step 1: Identify source and target template differences
- [ ] Step 2: Create new project with target template
- [ ] Step 3: Copy content sections (not preamble)
- [ ] Step 4: Adjust page limits and content
- [ ] Step 5: Update conference-specific requirements
- [ ] Step 6: Verify compilation and formatting
```

**Step 1: Key Template Differences**

| From → To | Page Change | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| NeurIPS → ICML | 9 → 8 pages | Cut 1 page, add Broader Impact if missing |
| ICML → ICLR | 8 → 9 pages | Can expand experiments, add LLM disclosure |
| NeurIPS → ACL | 9 → 8 pages | Restructure for NLP conventions, add Limitations |
| ICLR → AAAI | 9 → 7 pages | Significant cuts needed, strict style adherence |
| Any → COLM | varies → 9 | Reframe for language model focus |

**Step 2: Content Migration (NOT Template Merge)**

**Never copy LaTeX preambles between templates.** Instead:

```bash
# 1. Start fresh with target template
cp -r templates/icml2026/ new_submission/

# 2. Copy ONLY content sections from old paper
# - Abstract text
# - Section content (between \section{} commands)
# - Figures and tables
# - Bibliography entries

# 3. Paste into target template structure
```

**Step 3: Adjusting for Page Limits**

When cutting pages (e.g., NeurIPS 9 → AAAI 7):
- Move detailed proofs to appendix
- Condense related work (cite surveys instead of individual papers)
- Combine similar experiments into unified tables
- Use smaller figure sizes with subfigures
- Tighten writing: eliminate redundancy, use active voice

When expanding (e.g., ICML 8 → ICLR 9):
- Add ablation studies reviewers requested
- Expand limitations discussion
- Include additional baselines
- Add qualitative examples

**Step 4: Conference-Specific Adjustments**

| Target Venue | Required Additions |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **ICML** | Broader Impact Statement (after conclusion) |
| **ICLR** | LLM usage disclosure, reciprocal reviewing agreement |
| **ACL/EMNLP** | Limitations section (mandatory), Ethics Statement |
| **AAAI** | Strict adherence to style file (no modifications) |
| **NeurIPS** | Paper checklist (appendix), lay summary if accepted |

**Step 5: Update References**

```latex
% Remove self-citations that reveal identity (for blind review)
% Update any "under review" citations to published versions
% Add new relevant work published since last submission
```

**Step 6: Addressing Previous Reviews**

When resubmitting after rejection:
- **Do** address reviewer concerns in the new version
- **Do** add experiments/clarifications reviewers requested
- **Don't** include a "changes from previous submission" section (blind review)
- **Don't** reference the previous submission or reviews

**Common Conversion Pitfalls:**
- ❌ Copying `\usepackage` commands (causes conflicts)
- ❌ Keeping old conference header/footer commands
- ❌ Forgetting to update `\bibliography{}` path
- ❌ Missing conference-specific required sections
- ❌ Exceeding page limit after format change
