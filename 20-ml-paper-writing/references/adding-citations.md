# ML Paper Writing for Top AI Conferences: Citation Workflow (Hallucination Prevention)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: AI-generated citations have ~40% error rate. **Never write BibTeX from memory.**

## The Golden Rule

```text
IF you cannot programmatically fetch a citation:
    → Mark it as [CITATION NEEDED] or [PLACEHOLDER - VERIFY]
    → Tell the scientist explicitly
    → NEVER invent a plausible-sounding reference
```

## Workflow 2: Adding Citations

```text
Citation Verification (MANDATORY for every citation):
- [ ] Step 1: Search using Exa MCP or Semantic Scholar API
- [ ] Step 2: Verify paper exists in 2+ sources (Semantic Scholar + arXiv/CrossRef)
- [ ] Step 3: Retrieve BibTeX via DOI (programmatically, not from memory)
- [ ] Step 4: Verify the claim you're citing actually appears in the paper
- [ ] Step 5: Add verified BibTeX to bibliography
- [ ] Step 6: If ANY step fails → mark as placeholder, inform scientist
```

**Step 0: Use Exa MCP for Initial Search (Recommended)**

If Exa MCP is installed, use it to find relevant papers:
```text
Search: "RLHF language model alignment 2023"
Search: "sparse autoencoders interpretability"
Search: "attention mechanism transformers Vaswani"
```

Then verify each result with Semantic Scholar and fetch BibTeX via DOI.

**Step 1: Search Semantic Scholar**

```python
from semanticscholar import SemanticScholar

sch = SemanticScholar()
results = sch.search_paper("attention mechanism transformers", limit=5)
for paper in results:
    print(f"{paper.title} - {paper.paperId}")
    print(f"  DOI: {paper.externalIds.get('DOI', 'N/A')}")
```

**Step 2: Verify Existence**

Confirm paper appears in at least two sources (Semantic Scholar + CrossRef/arXiv).

**Step 3: Retrieve BibTeX via DOI**

```python
import requests

def doi_to_bibtex(doi: str) -> str:
    """Get verified BibTeX from DOI via CrossRef."""
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://doi.org/{doi}",
        headers={"Accept": "application/x-bibtex"}
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.text

# Example
bibtex = doi_to_bibtex("10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762")
print(bibtex)
```

**Step 4: Verify Claims**

Before citing for a specific claim, access the paper and confirm the attributed claim actually appears.

**Step 5: Handle Failures Explicitly**

If you cannot verify a citation at ANY step:

```latex
% Option 1: Explicit placeholder
\cite{PLACEHOLDER_smith2023_verify}  % TODO: Could not verify - scientist must confirm

% Option 2: Note in text
... as shown in prior work [CITATION NEEDED - could not verify Smith et al. 2023].
```

**Always inform the scientist:**
> "I could not verify the following citations and have marked them as placeholders:
> - Smith et al. 2023 on reward hacking - could not find in Semantic Scholar
> - Jones 2022 on scaling laws - found similar paper but different authors
> Please verify these before submission."

## Summary: Citation Rules

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Found paper, got DOI, fetched BibTeX | ✅ Use the citation |
| Found paper, no DOI | ✅ Use arXiv BibTeX or manual entry from paper |
| Paper exists but can't fetch BibTeX | ⚠️ Mark placeholder, inform scientist |
| Uncertain if paper exists | ❌ Mark `[CITATION NEEDED]`, inform scientist |
| "I think there's a paper about X" | ❌ **NEVER cite** - search first or mark placeholder |

**🚨 NEVER generate BibTeX from memory—always fetch programmatically. 🚨**
